install node for npm
install angular cli using npm i -g angular-cli
ng new first-app
cd first-app
ng serve

How do we tell angular to get started: angular-cli adds scripts during build process.
How is angular2 aware of our component, does it load all components by default. No, it doesn't load all components by default.
This is done through main.ts file (there is a main.bundle ..it contains our code + third party code to run our application)

BrowserModule
-------------
The metadata imports a single helper module, BrowserModule, which every browser app must import.
BrowserModule registers critical application service providers. It also includes common directives like NgIf and NgFor, which become immediately visible and usable in any of this module's component templates.
